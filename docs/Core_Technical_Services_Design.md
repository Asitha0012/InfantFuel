# 9. Core Technical Services Design (Cross-cutting concerns)

This section describes the detailed design and usage pattern for the core technical services that address common cross-cutting concerns of the InfantFuel solution.

## 9.1 Logging and Quality of Service Monitoring

### 9.1.1 Logging

The InfantFuel system implements comprehensive logging across all application layers to ensure proper monitoring, debugging, and audit trail capabilities.

#### Backend Logging Strategy

**Implementation:**
- **Framework**: Winston logging library for Node.js backend
- **Log Levels**: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
- **Log Format**: JSON structured logging for better parsing and analysis
- **Storage**: File-based logging with rotation and centralized log aggregation

**Logging Categories:**

1. **Authentication Logs**
   - User login/logout attempts
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - Password reset activities

2. **API Request Logs**
   - HTTP request/response logging
   - Request duration and performance metrics
   - Error tracking and stack traces
   - User activity tracking

3. **Database Operation Logs**
   - MongoDB query performance
   - Database connection status
   - Data modification audit trails
   - Connection pool monitoring

4. **Business Logic Logs**
   - Weight tracking entries
   - Event creation and modifications
   - Connection requests and approvals
   - Notification delivery status

**Log Structure Example:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T10:30:00.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "InfantFuel-Backend",
  "userId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "action": "WEIGHT_ENTRY_CREATED",
  "details": {
    "babyId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439012",
    "weight": 5.2,
    "recordedBy": "Healthcare Provider"
  },
  "requestId": "req-123456",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100"
}
```

#### Frontend Logging Strategy

**Implementation:**
- **Error Tracking**: Automatic JavaScript error capture
- **User Interaction Logging**: Click events, navigation patterns
- **Performance Monitoring**: Page load times, component render times
- **Console Logging**: Development debugging with production filtering

### 9.1.2 Quality of Service Monitoring (QoS)

Below describes use of the QoS functionalities of the InfantFuel product:

#### Performance Metrics Monitoring

2. **Throughput Monitoring**
   - Requests per second handling capacity
   - Concurrent user session management
   - Database connection pool utilization

3. **Availability Monitoring**
